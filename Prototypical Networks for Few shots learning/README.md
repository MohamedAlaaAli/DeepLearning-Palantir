# Prototypical Networks for Few-Shot Learning on Omniglot Dataset

This repository contains the implementation of Prototypical Networks for Few-Shot Learning, as introduced by Snell, Swersky, and Zemel in their seminal paper. This model addresses the challenge of few-shot learning â€“ the ability to recognize new concepts from a very limited number of examples. Our implementation focuses on the Omniglot dataset, a comprehensive collection of hand-drawn characters from various alphabets, making it an ideal benchmark for testing few-shot learning algorithms.

## Overview

Prototypical Networks learn a metric space in which classification can be performed by computing distances to prototype representations of each class. This approach is particularly well-suited for few-shot learning scenarios, where only a few examples per class are available. The Omniglot dataset, with its vast array of hand-drawn characters, provides a rich testing ground for evaluating the efficacy of Prototypical Networks in a few-shot learning context.

## Dataset

The Omniglot dataset will be automatically downloaded and processed the first time you run the training script. It is divided into background and evaluation sets, following the standard few-shot learning setup.
